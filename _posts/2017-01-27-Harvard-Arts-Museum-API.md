title: Harvard Arts Museum API Project

---
I loved making this project! It was my favorite one by far.  I was inspired by a cheap date idea that I had to take someone
to a museum.  I picked the Harvard Arts API just to kind of create a website to explore the Harvard Arts Museum and its
awesome exhibitions.

## Goals:
The goal for this project is to use an API and get information from the API to build a React site.  I implemented Semantic 
UI React to further modulerize the code and styling.

## Highs:
Going through this project I definitley had a lot of highs AND lows.  One of my favorite learning moments in this project was
manipulating the data.  I wanted to make this site specifically for the exhibitons aspect. I found that creating this to showcase
exhibitons was a lot to do especially since the API only allowed a link and not images for the exhibition.

## Lows:
One thing I had a diffciult time doign was implementing a search function through Redux.  I found that making the call inside
redux added an extra character to the Base URL and I couldn't figure out how to remove it.
