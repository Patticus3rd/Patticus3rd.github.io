title: Dont Crash Your Server The First Day
---

If you haven't already read, Jake crashed our database. We started the project off by creating our accounts for a new github-like website for our files.  After the training was underway we noticed the website was running really slow and eventually stopped working.  Thats when we got news that the server had crashed after they had tried to delete a branch from the server.
