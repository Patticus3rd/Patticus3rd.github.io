If you haven't already read, Jake crashed our database. We started the project off by creating our accounts for a new github-like website for our files.  After the training was underway we noticed the website was running really slow and eventually stopped working.  Thats when we got news that the server had crashed after they had tried to delete a branch from the server.

Following the website crash we eventually got dismissed to work individually.  What we need to do next is to create our database and structure out our models.  Working in the backend side of the project requires a clear understanding of different components and how they would work with each other.  We need to create associations and make sure that all the associations are according to our UML Diagram. These are the objectives we need to complete.  Join me tomorrow and find out how far we got!  Until next time coders!
