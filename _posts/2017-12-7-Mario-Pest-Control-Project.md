### My First Project!!

## Goal:
The Goal set for this project is to implement Javascript into a simple HTML Page.  The overall theme for the project is to create a Counter for Mario when catching Baddies. 

## Highs:
I had a lot of fun doing this project since it was Mario Themed.  One of the light bulb moments I had was when I had trouble outputing the Counters.  It had something to do with the Pass By Reference variables that I had in each function.  It did not update the counter because when the server reads the JS file, it would just update the counter in JS but not on the HTML file.

## Lows:
The hard part about this project was keeping track of the file systems. I had a hard time trying to style each individual component.  Originally I had set the images in a folder and got really confused. Looking back, I would definitley still use folders because I can keep better track of them now.
